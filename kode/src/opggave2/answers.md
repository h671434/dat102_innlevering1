```txt
   i: 4*n^2 + 50*n - 10 -> O(n^2) 
   ii: 10*n + 4* log_2(n) + 30 -> O(n) 
   iii: 13*n^3 22*n^2 + 50*n + 20 -> O(n^3) 
   iv: 35 + 13*log_2(n) -> O(log(n))
```

> question 2b

given the follwing algorithm find O and the amount of times "=" is used:
```java
sum = 0;
 for (int i = n; i > 1; i = i/2) {
  sum = sum + i;
 }
```
In each iteration the iterator is halved, and the process will continue until the iterator is greater than 1.
Thus, to find the number of iterations we have to use log base 2 e.g. given that n is 8 then we have 3 iterations and "=" is assigned thrice.
log_2(8) = 3 (1 : 8, 2 : 4, 3 : 2 )
Therefore O(log(n))

> Question 2c

(Same as 2b) for the following code:
```java
sum = 0;
 for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  for (int j = 1; j <= n; j = j * 2) {
   sum += i * j;
  }
 }
 ```
 for each iteration of i we loop through the nested for loop n times, and we loop through the outer loop n times too.
 Thus, we can find that in total we iterate n * n times.
 Such that if n is 3 we loop through the loop a total of 3^2 = 9 times
 O(n^2)


 >Question 2d

 Big O notation for the are and circumfrance of a circle: \
        > double area = 2 * Math.PI * r^2; \
        > double circumfrance = 2 * Math.PI * r; \
 The expression of the area is quadratic or a second degree polynomial and follows hence O(n^2)
 While the expression of the circumfrance is linear, hence, O(n)
 
> Question 2e

Find big O and the number of iterations in the worst case

```java
boolean harDuplikat(int tabell[], int n) {

for (int indeks = 0; indeks <= n - 2; indeks++) {
    for (int igjen = indeks + 1; igjen <= n - 1; igjen++) {
        if (tabell[indeks] == tabell[igjen]){
            return true;
          }
        }
    }
return false;
}
```

It's O(n^2) for the same reason as 2d is, even though there are less iterations of this loop as igjen is a higher value for each iteration
In the worst case the number of iterations is the sum of n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = (n^2 + n)/2.
This is becasue the iterator goes through the array less for each iteration 


> Question 2f

find big O for the following and rank them:
```txt
i. t_1(𝑛)=8𝑛+4𝑛^3 -> O(n^3)
ii. t_2(𝑛)=10*log(𝑛)+20 -> O(log(n))
iii. t_3(𝑛)=20𝑛+2𝑛log2𝑛+11 -> O(n*log(n))
iv. t_4(𝑛)=4log2𝑛+2𝑛 -> O(n) 
```

in this case the second expression is the most effective. From best to worst:
1. t_2
2. t_4
3. t_3
4. t_1

> Question 2g

Look at the TwoG.java for the code!

The O notation is a rough estimate on how long an algorithm will take given a dataset of size n.

As said in the exercise the O notation of the method is O(n), which is a general expression. This tells us that the 
time it will take will increase linearly with n. To get a specific estimate of the time it will take we will have to add
a constant such that \
```txt
t(n) = c*n
```
if we solve for the constant when we know the time it takes for an algorithm to compute and n we can find the
function for how time varies with n on a specific computer.

In practice, it doesn't work quite as well as we can see by running the java class in this directory.
On my machine the average time from running the method 200 times was 12.0, 92.0, and 613.6 ms. This doesn't match the
theory to such a great extent as the average should increase by a factor of 10 each time n increases by a factor of 10.
